Polynomial Regression for Cost Prediction
Overview
This project implements a Polynomial Regression model to predict costs based on input data. Polynomial Regression extends the capabilities of linear regression by fitting a polynomial equation to the data, allowing for modeling non-linear relationships effectively. The project demonstrates how to preprocess data, train the model, and visualize results, making it suitable for applications where costs depend on complex, non-linear variables.

Features
Data Preprocessing:

Cleaning and preparing the dataset for modeling.
Feature engineering to handle non-linear relationships.
Modeling:

Implementation of Polynomial Regression using scikit-learn.
Comparison of polynomial regression with linear regression to highlight improvements in prediction accuracy.
Visualization:

Clear, interpretable plots to showcase data trends and model performance.
Visualization of the polynomial curve fitting the data.
Evaluation:

Model performance metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared score.
Technologies Used
Python: Programming language for implementation.
Libraries:
numpy: Numerical computations.
pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

Visual Insights
The project includes detailed plots that:
Show the relationship between the independent variables and the cost.
Visualize how polynomial regression fits the data better compared to linear regression.
Applications
Polynomial Regression can be applied to solve real-world problems such as:

Predicting housing costs based on multiple factors (e.g., size, location).
Estimating manufacturing costs in industries.
Forecasting pricing trends in retail or logistics.
